                <p>A cool feature of this website (in my opinion!) is
                that all pages are static and all page links are
                relative to each other. There’s no server-side code that
                needs to run, and no CDNs that need to be hit to
                download gigabytes of JavaScript libraries for you to
                view it. For the non-technologically-inclined, this just
                means that the technology required to run this website
                is extremely simple. All the files are freely available,
                and you can very easily just download the whole site and
                browse it locally on your computer! Or for those who are
                more technically inclined, it’s pretty straightforward
                to host/mirror yourself with just a few commands.</p>
                <h2 id="why">Why?!</h2>
                <p>“Why on earth would I want to do that?” you
                exclaim.</p>
                <p>Please indulge me in this very reasonable, very
                serious, and really quite plausible scenario: imagine
                that you’re out in a cabin in the middle of the woods.
                You’ve just gotten into an argument with your friend
                about whether the Planet Xchange thrift shop listed in
                <a href="knoxville.html">The Knoxville Index</a> is
                located on Kingston Pike or Cedar Bluff. Google Maps is
                currently not working, you blame the cabin WiFi. Your
                friend has an iPhone and tries using whatever maps app
                thing Apple has, but in a freak accident last night, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray#Effect_on_electronics">cosmic
                radiation</a> from a solar storm simultaneously struck
                every hard drive in Apple’s servers that happened to
                contain the location information for the Planet Xchange
                in Knoxville, and it just keeps referring you to <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island">some
                weird “null island” thing</a> now. To make matters
                WORSE, it doesn’t even look like the <a
                href="https://warmcyan.eco">warmcyan.eco</a> website is
                running, because unfortunately a meteorite landed on the
                power pole right outside my house, taking my wonderful
                server offline. This is obviously more likely than you
                just not having internet or cell service out in the
                woods.</p>
                <p>Anyway, spurred on by an insatiable need to prove
                your friend wrong, you remember that previous-you was
                smart and followed level 1 protocols listed below – you
                have a copy of this very website on your laptop! You
                pull it out, boot it up, open the
                <code>knoxville.html</code> page in your web browser
                (how cool, it looks exactly like as if you really were
                on <a href="https://warmcyan.eco">warmcyan.eco</a>!),
                and triumphantly show your friend that the
                aforementioned thrift shop is indeed on Kingston.
                Nice!</p>

                <p>More seriously, <strong>decentralization</strong>
                (some interesting wikipedia links: <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization#Centralization_and_re-decentralization_of_the_Internet">decentralization</a>,
                <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_web">decentralized
                web</a>) vs <strong>centralization</strong> is a really
                important concept both in technology and in life more
                broadly. There are pros and cons to both, but I’m going
                to claim that more stuff on the decentralized side is
                often better – it mitigates issues regarding
                control/power, as well as reliability.</p>
                <p>Spotify and Netflix are two examples of highly
                centralized services. In each case, one company has
                total centralized control of your media: you have to go
                through their systems and services to access the media
                that they own. On the one hand, this has some obvious
                benefits. For a monthly subscription fee, you’re granted
                access to massive catalogs, and there’s no resource
                requirements placed on you, e.g. storage space, either
                physical (CD’s, albums, DVD’s) or digital (hard drive
                space). This is overall more convenient and cheaper if
                your goal is to consume large quantities of diverse
                stuff! The downside is that you have zero control over
                “your” media. Netflix has the ability to remove (and
                often does) anything from their servers at will. I’m
                sure most people have at least one example of a good
                show getting moved to a different streaming platform
                they didn’t have a subscription for!</p>
                <p>The decentralized version of this is to buy
                music/shows/movies in physical (or digital download)
                form. It doesn’t matter if the original source of
                something you own a copy of gets removed or deleted, you
                have your own local version of it! You can let a friend
                borrow it without Netflix getting upset that you’re
                sharing your password with someone. You can play it on
                lots of different hardware and software, without being
                stuck with Spotify’s interface. You fundamentally have
                control over your own media and aren’t even dependent on
                an internet connection in this scenario.</p>

                <h3
                id="so-why-allow-decentralization-of-this-website">So
                why allow decentralization of this website?</h3>
                <p>In part, to experiment with and demonstrate that it’s
                possible. Not every website is (or even should be) dirt
                simple, but there are plenty (personal blogs, wiki’s,
                etc.) that could be if people wanted! My goal is to
                highlight that you can create content, information, and
                knowledge for other people in a way where they aren’t
                exclusively dependent on your (or anyone’s) server being
                up for them to access it. If even one other person grabs
                an offline version of this website (or better yet hosts
                it themselves for others), the information on this site
                lives on regardless of if my raspberry pi crashes or my
                internet goes down! The site can be “hosted” via <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">sneakernet</a>
                if need be! Similarly from the consumption side, my goal
                is to highlight that you can own significant quantities
                of information completely locally and offline, again
                without depending on internet or other
                people’s/company’s infrastructure (for a <em>super</em>
                interesting example of this, take a gander at <a
                href="https://kiwix.org/en/">kiwix</a>).</p>
                <p>There are certainly other means of doing this that
                rely on more technical solutions (e.g. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a>,
                <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphanet">freenet</a>)
                but the approaches listed below require only “standard”
                tools (based on level). The biggest downside to
                following them is namely the fact that the content isn’t
                “live”. If I make a change to one of the pages on this
                site, the next time you access it via the warmcyan.eco
                URL, you’ll see those new changes. If you access your
                local version, those changes won’t be there, so you have
                to manually go and fetch the new content based on the
                level.</p>
                <p>A random fun thing enabled by having your own copy of
                this website is search! Since these are static pages, I
                don’t have any search functionality directly integrated
                into the website, but if you download the files you can
                use whatever search utility (e.g. the windows file
                explorer’s search function) to find the page or text
                you’re looking for.</p>

                - I have used a computer before</h3>
                <p>No more knowledge is necessary than that to download
                and access an offline copy of this website!</p>
                <p>The raw files for this website are (currently)
                mirrored on <a
                href="https://github.com/WarmCyan/warmcyan.eco">github</a>.
                To download a zip of those files, click this link: <a
                href="https://github.com/WarmCyan/warmcyan.eco/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">https://github.com/WarmCyan/warmcyan.eco/archive/refs/heads/main.zip</a>.</p>
                <p>Once you have the zip file downloaded, just unzip it
                (on windows you can probably right click on it and
                “extract” or “extract all files here” etc.), and click
                on the newly extracted <code>index.html</code>. This
                should open the homepage in your browser and you’re good
                to go!</p>
                <p>(Alas this doesn’t work well on a phone, at least on
                android most browsers open up raw HTML files in a way
                that doesn’t let them access other local files.)</p>
                <h3 id="level-2---i-know-what-git-is">Level 2 - I know
                what git is</h3>
                <p>It’s like level 1 but somehow easier! Run:</p>
                <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/WarmCyan/warmcyan.eco.git</code></pre>
                <p>and click on <code>index.html</code>. Done!</p>
                <p>This approach also makes it quicker to update your
                local version when I make changes, the new hot stuff
                fresh off the press is one <code>git pull</code>
                away.</p>

                <p>If you want to get fancy and have a python
                environment, you can minimally re-host your own version
                of this website by following either level 1 or level 2
                to get the files locally and then using python’s nifty
                simple server by navigating to the files and
                running:</p>
                <pre><code>python -m http.server 8989</code></pre>
                <p>which will spin up a web server hosting the files at
                port <code>8989</code>!</p>
                <p>See <a
                href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#command-line-interface">the
                http.server docs</a> for more info on options you can
                use.</p>
                <p>(this is all built-in stuff, no <code>pip</code>
                installs necessary)</p>
                <p>This does work in <a

                <p>You really probably don’t need my suggestions for
                this if you’ve gotten this far and are somehow seriously
                considering it, and I’m too lazy to go grab the NGINX
                server block I have on my pi right now. But, at some
                point I’ll put a full setup with cron job to regularly
                re-pull the git stuff.</p>
