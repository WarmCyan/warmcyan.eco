                <p>Here it is, the beginning of the digital garden I’ve
                been telling myself for years I would create and put out
                there for some tiny portion of the world to explore!</p>
                <p>There’s not much here yet, this is a space I intend
                to cultivate and grow over time. It’s not quite a blog,
                it’s not quite a wiki – it’s a space I can play in and
                talk about things and share my projects and other stuff
                I think is cool. Maybe it’ll even provide value to
                someone other than me someday! It’s my own little place
                in the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>, a
                teenie tiny spot on the giant interwebs that is meant to
                be slow and cozy and warm. There’s no ads here, no AI
                recommended articles for you to click on, I’m not
                selling anything and there are no sponsors. It’s just
                me, my little raspberry pi, and some digital thoughts,
                writings, and explorations, and I invite you to peruse
                them at your leisure!</p>
                <p>The main interesting page here right now is <a
                href="knoxville.html">The Knoxville Index</a>, a semi
                disorganized list of neat stuff around my hometown! I
                think most sane people agree community is pretty
                important, so if you live around here maybe there’s
                something on that page that will help you build yours,
                or at least find something new in Knoxville you didn’t
                know about!</p>
                <p>I also briefly stand on a soap box and talk about
                decentralization and discuss how you can self-host this
                website yourself with either zero or lots of
                self-hosting experience! See <a
                href="decentralized-warmcyan-website.html">Decentralized
                WarmCyan Website</a>.</p>
                <p>I’m trying to do project write-ups and documentation
                so other people can learn from my mistakes, here’s the
                <a href="projects/index.html">Projects archive</a>, and
                my recent project highlights:</p>
                <ul class="incremental">
                <li>Non-techy: <a
                href="projects/rescue-couch-corner.html">Rescue couch
                corner</a></li>
                <li>Techy: <a href="projects/git-auth-shell.html">Git
                auth shell</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>I’m also gradually posting my favorite recipes on my
                <a href="recipes/index.html">Recipe list</a> to make
                them easier to share!</p>
                <p>Enjoy!<br />
