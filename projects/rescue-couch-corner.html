                <p>Ever since I moved, my living room couch is no longer
                against a wall, and the back corners are exposed. One of
                my cats has decided it’s an excellent scratching post,
                and she makes frequent use of it, classic.</p>

                <p>From experience, there’s not really anything I can do
                that will outright dissuade her from using this prime
                fabric real estate, so I figured it’d be best to just
                roll with it and turn that corner into something she can
                scratch to her heart’s content, without opening a hole
                into the couch itself and getting white fluff
                EVERYWHERE. Commence Project Wanton Upholstery

                <p>I got this cheap rug from the store that seemed
                vaguely the correct size and color, and I was almost
                close enough on both counts! My goal was to just
                wrap/sew this around the damaged corner, protecting it
                from further damage and hopefully still tempting enough
                that she doesn’t instead target some other innocent and
                unsuspecting piece of furniture.</p>

                <p>I had one of those super chonk curved upholstery
                needles (important since I only have access to one side
                of the material I’m sewing onto) and some upholstery
                thread pictured below, and the plan was to use a <a
                href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_stitch">whip
                stitch</a> all the way around to affix the rug to the
                couch.</p>
                <p><img

                alt="Pasted image 20250418105140.png" /></p>
                <p>I took some inspiration for how to do this from <a
                href="https://thedomesticwildflower.com/how-to-use-a-curved-needle-to-mend-upholstery/">this
                post</a>.</p>
                <p>The thread:</p>
                <p><img src="../res/files/20250418_104446.jpg"
                alt="20250418_104446.jpg" /></p>
                <p>I’m never sure how to correctly determine the length
                of thread to use, so I just cut a piece of thread 3x the
                length of the top of the rug and planned to sew multiple
                sections/e.g. each side separately. 3x was enough for
                half of the top border, ended up doing 4x for the other
                half of the top and each other side. I used the extra
                length to double over every few stitches, just to make
                sure it would hold sufficiently well.</p>
                <p>The rug I’m using is 17.4 x 30” and the first problem
                I encountered is that 17.4” is way too tall and hangs
                off the bottom, because I’d been too lazy to
                <em>actually measure</em> beforehand:</p>
                <p><img src="../res/files/20250418_124105.jpg"
                alt="20250418_124105.jpg" /></p>
                <p>My inelegant solution was to partially sew along the
                bottom/just under the rim of the couch, switching to (I
                think?) a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstitch">backstitch</a>
                since I was no longer sewing along the border. This was
                really difficult because of the limited room underneath
                (I have a thin board of MDF nailed on the bottom because
                my cats <em>also</em> previously tore the fabric from
                underneath and liked hiding inside the couch.) In
                retrospect, it would have been better to flip the couch
                over and just drive some more nails through both rug and
                board, which would likely have kept it tighter/folded
                underneath more cleanly.</p>
                <p>Here’s an image from when I’d started sewing along
                the top, you can see the stitches if you look closely,
                but it mostly blends in and successfully holds up when
                kitty chooses violence.</p>
                <p><img src="../res/files/20250418_121211.jpg"
                alt="20250418_121211.jpg" /></p>
                <p>The final product is shown below, the extra length
                means that it visibly wraps around the back wooden foot,
                and given the weird size/shape of the foot the stitching
                underneath only goes in about a quarter of the length of
                the border on each side. The weird curve of the couch
                also makes it so that the top of the rug can’t be
                parallel to the ground on both sides simultaneously, so
                I had to choose which side I thought would be more
                visible/obvious (I chose the back/left side of the
                photo.)</p>
