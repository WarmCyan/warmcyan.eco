                <h1 id="the-knoxville-index">The Knoxville Index</h1>
                <p>Knoxville has a ton of neat stuff! This page is a
                list I’m curating of a very small portion of it.</p>
                <p>One of my goals has been to get more involved in
                local community and to prefer buying from small, local
                businesses. While there’s a ton of opportunities for
                that, a challenge for me has been finding and keeping
                track of them. I’m maintaining this index both for
                myself and anyone else who might find it useful - I’m
                trying to collect info and links to various community
                and advocacy groups, local businesses, city government
                info, and other places to find information and events in
                town.</p>
                <p>I will eventually set up an RSS feed for this page
                that will list updates as I make them, so if you’re an
                RSS kind of person, stay tuned.</p>

                Community/Advocacy Groups</h2>
                <p><a href="https://yesknoxville.org/">YES!
                Knoxville</a><br />
                Non-profit movement advocating for better housing,
                transportation, and community spaces. They usually have
                a monthly social meetup every first Sunday at a
                brewery.</p>
                <p><a
                href="https://justiceknox.org/">JusticeKnox</a><br />
                Very large local non-profit action group. They are a
                church oriented organization, but you’re able to join
                without being affiliated with one. (That said, I emailed
                them once and never heard back, will try again soon.)
                The idea I think is that collectively the group decides
                what issues they want to consider/research/propose
                action on, and then collectively work towards engaging
                lawmakers/taking action, etc. They decide on one issue a
                year to focus on, and have a large initial meeting about
                it open to anyone. <em><strong>Upcoming “Nehemiah Action
                Assembly” for this year is April 8, 2025, 7-8:30 PM,

                Permaculture and sustainability group in south knox,
                haven’t been yet, but it looks like they have a
                newsletter and you can volunteer/join. They seem to have
                a pretty active calendar with classes and events (NOTE:
                calendar currently appears to be down)</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.bwknox.org/">Bike Walk

                Advocacy group for safer/accessible streets for biking
                and walking. I think they’re the organizers of the Walk
                with Elected Officials events, where the mayor and
                transportation board people come and anyone can join in
                a walk around Knoxville to discuss status, issues,
                etc.</p>

                like they meet every third wednesday of the month. I
                think they get involved in various volunteer projects,
                their website highlighted an event where they planted
                some trees around Solway. First two meetings for new
                people are free.</p>
